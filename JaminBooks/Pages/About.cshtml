                        Jamin' Books is a project developed by James Allison and Michael Petete for a database class at College of the Ozarks
                        in 2018, developed over the course of eight weeks as the class's final project. The e-commerce book store website was named after the acronym J.A.M which stood for "James and Michael".
                        From the acronym J.A.M the name "JAMing Books" was derived, formated as "Jamin' Books", and the brand evolved
                        to match the meaning of the acronym written as one word, "jam".
